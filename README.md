# CairoPlot

Simple plot tool based on [JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl), which itself is an adaptation (binding) to Julia of the [Cairo](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl) C library.

The aim here is to have a plotting tool with minimal dependencies and fast.

It is still a work in progress and it is a not a registered package yet.
